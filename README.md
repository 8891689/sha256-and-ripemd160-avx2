# Introduction: A High-Performance Parallel SHA-256 Implementation with AVX2

This is a SHA-256 implementation optimized for modern x86-64 CPUsã€‚

with the primary goal of maximizing computational throughput. 

It leverages the AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2) instruction set to achieve the parallel processing of 8 independent data blocks simultaneously.

# Core Technical Features:

1. 8-Way Parallelism:
By utilizing AVX2's 256-bit vector registers, each capable of holding eight 32-bit integersã€‚ 

the design allows every SHA-256 operation (such as addition, XOR, and rotation) to be applied to 8 separate hash computation streams at the same time.

2. SoA (Structure of Arrays) Data Layout:
To facilitate vectorized computation, the data layout is transformed from the traditional "hash states one after another" (AoS) to a "structure of arrays" (SoA) formatã€‚

where all 'a' states are grouped together, all 'b' states are grouped together, and so on. This layout is crucial for achieving high-performance parallel processing.

Efficient Data Transposition:
The code includes a highly optimized transposition module. 

It uses a sequence of unpack, permute, and shuffle instructions to rapidly convert 8 independent input data blocks (64 bytes each) into the SoA format required for parallel computationã€‚

efficiently preparing the data for the core compression loop.

3. Optimized Compression Loop:
2-Way Loop Unrolling: The main loop processes two rounds (i and i+1) per iteration. 

This moderate level of unrolling provides the CPU's out-of-order execution engine with sufficient independent instructions to hide latencyã€‚

while avoiding the instruction cache and register pressure issues caused by excessive unrolling.

Constant Pre-loading: Before the main computation begins, all required SHA-256 K constants are pre-loaded and broadcast into vector registers. 

This eliminates the overhead of repeatedly generating these constants inside the critical loop.

4. Performance:
On a modern CPU equipped with AVX2 and compiled with optimization flags such as -O3 -march=nativeã€‚

this implementation can achieve an exceptional performance of over 15 million SHA-256 block computations per secondã€‚

with a data throughput approaching 1 GB/s.

Based on IntelÂ® XeonÂ® E5-2697 v4 2.30 GHz single-threaded environment
